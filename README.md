## Why do we need marginal effects?

Results of regression models are typically presented as tables that are easy to understand. For more complex models that include interaction or quadratic / spline terms, tables with numbers are less helpful and difficult to interpret. In such cases, _marginal effects_ are far easier to understand. In particular, the visualization of marginal effects makes it possible to intuitively get the idea of how predictors and outcome are associated, even for complex models. 

## Aim of this package

**ggeffects** computes marginal effects at the mean or average marginal effects from statistical models and returns the result as tidy data frames. These data frames are ready to use with the **ggplot2**-package.

## ggeffects supports many different models and is easy to use

Marginal effects can be calculated for many different models. Currently supported model-objects are: `lm`, `glm`, `glm.nb`, `lme`, `lmer`, `glmer`, `glmer.nb`, `nlmer`, `glmmTMB`, `gam` (package **mgcv**), `vgam`, `gamm`, `gamm4`, `multinom`, `betareg`, `truncreg`, `coxph`, `gls`, `gee`, `plm`, `lrm`, `polr`, `clm`, `zeroinfl`, `hurdle`, `stanreg`, `brmsfit`, `lmRob`, `glmRob`, `brglm`, `rlm`, `svyglm` and `svyglm.nb`. Other models not listed here are passed to a generic predict-function and might work as well, or maybe with `ggeffect()`, which effectively does the same as `ggpredict()`.

Interaction terms, splines and polynomial terms are also supported. The two main functions are `ggpredict()` and `ggaverage()`, however, there are some convenient wrapper-functions especially for polynomials or interactions. There is a generic `plot()`-method to plot the results using **ggplot2**.

## Examples

The returned data frames always have the same, consistent structure and column names, so it's easy to create ggplot-plots without the need to re-write the function call. `x` and `predicted` are the values for the x- and y-axis. `conf.low` and `conf.high` could be used as `ymin` and `ymax` aesthetics for ribbons to add confidence bands to the plot. `group` can be used as grouping-aesthetics, or for faceting.

`ggpredict()` requires at least one, but not more than three terms specified in the `terms`-argument. Predicted values of the response, along the values of the first term are calucalted, optionally grouped by the other terms specified in `terms`.

```
data(efc)
fit <- lm(barthtot ~ c12hour + neg_c_7 + c161sex + c172code, data = efc)

ggpredict(fit, terms = "c12hour")
#> # A tibble: 62 × 6
#>        x predicted conf.low conf.high  group
#>    <dbl>     <dbl>    <dbl>     <dbl> <fctr>
#> 1      4  74.43040 72.33073  76.53006      1
#> 2      5  74.17710 72.09831  76.25588      1
#> 3      6  73.92379 71.86555  75.98204      1
#> 4      7  73.67049 71.63242  75.70857      1
#> 5      8  73.41719 71.39892  75.43546      1
#> 6      9  73.16389 71.16504  75.16275      1
#> 7     10  72.91059 70.93076  74.89042      1
#> 8     11  72.65729 70.69608  74.61850      1
#> 9     12  72.40399 70.46098  74.34700      1
#> 10    14  71.89738 69.98948  73.80529      1
#> # ... with 52 more rows
```

A possible call to ggplot could look like this:

```
library(ggplot2)
mydf <- ggpredict(fit, terms = "c12hour")
ggplot(mydf, aes(x, predicted)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high), alpha = .1)
```
![](man/figures/README-example-1.png)

However, there is also a `plot()`-method. This method uses convenient defaults, to easily create the most suitable plot for the marginal effects.

```
mydf <- ggpredict(fit, terms = "c12hour")
plot(mydf)
```
![](man/figures/README-example-2.png)

`plot()` offers a few, but useful arguments, so it's easy to use.

With three variables, predictions can be grouped and faceted.

```
ggpredict(fit, terms = c("c12hour", "c172code", "c161sex"))
#> # A tibble: 372 × 7
#>        x predicted  conf.low conf.high                           group      facet
#>    <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>                          <fctr>     <fctr>

#> 7      5  74.44742  72.14644  76.74841 intermediate level of education [2] Female
#> 8      5  73.72907  70.21926  77.23888          low level of education [2] Female
#> 9      5  75.16578  71.67430  78.65726         high level of education [2] Female
#> 10     5  73.40600  69.84575  76.96625 intermediate level of education   [1] Male

mydf <- ggpredict(fit, terms = c("c12hour", "c172code", "c161sex"))
ggplot(mydf, aes(x = x, y = predicted, colour = group)) +
  stat_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(~facet)
```
![](man/figures/README-example-3.png)

`plot()` works for this case, as well:

```
plot(mydf)
```
