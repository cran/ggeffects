\title{Get marginal effects for model response}
\usage{
emm(model, ci.lvl = 0.95, type = c("fe", "re"), typical = "mean", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{A fitted model object, or a list of model objects. Any model
that supports common methods like \code{predict()}, \code{family()}
or \code{model.frame()} should work.}

\item{ci.lvl}{Numeric, the level of the confidence intervals. For \code{ggpredict()},
use \code{ci.lvl = NA}, if confidence intervals should not be calculated
(for instance, due to computation time).}

\item{type}{Character, only applies for mixed effects models. Indicates
whether predicted values should be conditioned on random effects
(\code{type = "re"}) or fixed effects only (\code{type = "fe"},
the default). If \code{type = "re"}, the uncertainty in the variance
parameters is currently not taken into account. The specific levels of
the random effects are not provided in the \code{newdata}-argument. Hence,
if \code{type = "re"}, \code{predict()} is called with \code{re.form = NULL},
i.e. predictions are conditioned on random effects only using the first level
of random effects, but the uncertainty in the variance parameters is ignored.}

\item{typical}{Character vector, naming the function to be applied to the
covariates over which the effect is "averaged". The default is "mean".
See \code{\link[sjstats]{typical_value}} for options.}

\item{...}{Further arguments passed down to \code{predict()}.}
}
\value{
A tibble with the marginal effect of the response (\code{predicted})
        and the confidence intervals \code{conf.low} and \code{conf.high}.
        For \code{polr}-objects, the marginal effect for each level of the
        response variable is returned.
}
\description{
\code{emm()} is a convenient shortcut to compute the estimated
             marginal mean, resp. the marginal effect of the model's response
             variable, with all independent variables held constant (at
             their \code{\link[sjstats]{typical_value}}).
}
\details{
For linear models, the predicted value is the estimated marginal
         mean. Else, the predicted value is on the scale of the inverse of
         link function.
