  typical = c("mean", "median"), ...)

ame(model, terms, ci.lvl = 0.95, type = c("fe", "re"), typical = c("mean",

}
\arguments{
\item{model}{A fitted model object, or a list of model objects. Any model
that supports common methods like \code{predict()}, \code{family()}
or \code{model.frame()} should work.}

\item{terms}{Character vector with the names of those terms from \code{model},
for which marginal effects should be displayed. At least one term
is required to calculate effects, maximum length is three terms,
where the second and third term indicate the groups, i.e. predictions
of first term are grouped by the levels of the second (and third)
term. Indicating levels in square brackets allows for selecting
only specific groups. Term name and levels in brackets must be
separated by a whitespace character, e.g.
\code{terms = c("age", "education [1,3]")}. See 'Examples'.
All remaining covariates that are not specified in \code{terms}
are held constant (if \code{full.data = FALSE}, the default)
or are set to the values from the observations (i.e. are kept
as they happen to be; see 'Details').}

\item{ci.lvl}{Numeric, the level of the confidence intervals. For \code{ggpredict()},
use \code{ci.lvl = NA}, if confidence intervals should not be calculated
(for instance, due to computation time).}

\item{type}{Character, only applies for mixed effects models. Indicates whether
predicted values should be conditioned on random effects
(\code{type = "re"}) or fixed effects only (\code{type = "fe"}, the
default).}

\item{typical}{Character vector, naming the function to be applied to the
covariates over which the effect is "averaged". The default is "mean".}

\item{...}{Further arguments passed down to \code{predict()}.}

\item{full.data}{Logical, if \code{TRUE}, the returned data frame contains
predictions for all observations. This data frame also has columns
for residuals and observed values, and can also be used to plot a
scatter plot of all data points or fitted values.
If \code{FALSE} (the default), the returned data frame only contains
predictions for all combinations of unique values of the model's
predictors. Residuals and observed values are set to \code{NA}.
Usually, this argument is only used internally by \code{ggaverage()}.}
}
\value{
A tibble (with \code{ggeffects} class attribute) with consistent data columns:
        \describe{
          \item{\code{x}}{the values of the first term in \code{terms}, used as x-position in plots.}
          \item{\code{predicted}}{the predicted values, used as y-position in plots.}
          \item{\code{conf.low}}{the lower bound of the confidence interval for the predicted values.}
          \item{\code{conf.high}}{the upper bound of the confidence interval for the predicted values.}
          \item{\code{observed}}{if \code{full.data = TRUE}, this columns contains the observed values (the response vector).}
          \item{\code{residuals}}{if \code{full.data = TRUE}, this columns contains residuals.}
          \item{\code{group}}{the grouping level from the second term in \code{terms}, used as grouping-aesthetics in plots.}
          \item{\code{facet}}{the grouping level from the third term in \code{terms}, used to indicate facets in plots.}
        }
}
\description{
\code{ggpredict()} computes predicted (fitted) values for the
               response, at the margin of specific values from certain model terms,
               where additional model terms indicate the grouping structure.
               \code{ggaverage()} computes the average predicted values.
               The result is returned as tidy data frame.
               \cr \cr
               \code{mem()} is an alias for \code{ggpredict()} (marginal effects
               at the mean), \code{ame()} is an alias for \code{ggaverage()}
               (average marginal effects).
}
\details{
Currently supported model-objects are: \code{lm, glm, lme, lmer, glmer,
         glmer.nb, nlmer, glmTMB, gam, vgam, gamm, gamm4, gls, gee, plm, lrm,
         svyglm, svyglm.nb}. Other models not listed here are passed to a generic
         predict-function and might work as well, or maybe with \code{ggeffect()},
         which effectively does the same as \code{ggpredict()}.
         \cr \cr
         If \code{full.data = FALSE}, \code{expand.grid()} is called
         on all unique combinations of \code{model.frame(model)[, terms]} and
         used as \code{newdata}-argument for \code{predict()}. In this case,
         all remaining covariates that are not specified in \code{terms} are
         held constant. Numeric values are set to the mean (unless changed
         with the \code{typical}-argument), factors are set to their
         reference level and character vectors to the most common element.
         \cr \cr
         \code{ggaverage()} computes the average predicted values, by calling
         \code{ggpredict()} with \code{full.data = TRUE}, where argument
         \code{newdata = model.frame(model)} is used in \code{predict()}.
         Hence, predictions are made on the model data. In this case, all
         remaining covariates that are not specified in \code{terms} are
         \emph{not} held constant, but vary between observations (and are
         kept as they happen to be). The predicted values are then averaged
         for each group (if any).
         \cr \cr
         Thus, \code{ggpredict()} can be considered as calculating marginal
         effects at the mean, while \code{ggaverage()} computes average
         marginal effects.
}
\note{
Since data for \code{ggaverage()} comes from the model frame, not all
      possible combinations of values in \code{terms} might be present in the data,
      thus lines or confidence bands from \code{plot()} might not span over
      the complete x-axis-range.
