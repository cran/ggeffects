}
\arguments{
\item{model}{A fitted model object, or a list of model objects. Any model
that supports common methods like \code{predict()}, \code{family()}
or \code{model.frame()} should work. For \code{ggeffect()}, any model
that is supported by the \CRANpkg{effects}-package should work.}

\item{terms}{Character vector (or a formula) with the names of those terms
from \code{model}, for which marginal effects should be displayed. At least
one term is required to calculate effects for certain terms, maximum length is
three terms, where the second and third term indicate the groups, i.e.
predictions of first term are grouped by the levels of the second (and third)
term. If \code{terms} is missing or \code{NULL}, marginal effects for each
model term are calculated. It is also possible to define specific values for
terms, at which marginal effects should be calculated (see 'Details').
All remaining covariates that are not specified in \code{terms} are held
constant (if \code{full.data = FALSE}, the default) or are set to the
values from the observations (i.e. are kept as they happen to be;
see 'Details'). See also argument \code{condition} and \code{typical}.}

\item{ci.lvl}{Numeric, the level of the confidence intervals. For \code{ggpredict()},
use \code{ci.lvl = NA}, if confidence intervals should not be calculated
(for instance, due to computation time).}

\item{type}{Character, only applies for mixed effects models and/or models
with zero-inflation.
\describe{
  \item{\code{"fe"}}{
  Predicted values are conditioned on the fixed effects or conditional
  model only. For instance, for models fitted with \code{zeroinfl} from
  \pkg{pscl}, this would return the predicted mean from the count component
  (without zero-inflation). For models of class \code{glmmTMB}, this type
  calls \code{predict(..., type = "link")}.
  }
  \item{\code{"re"}}{
  Predicted values are conditioned on the random effects. This only applies
  to mixed models, and \code{type = "re"} does not condition on the
  zero-inflation component of the model, nor on different group levels.
  \code{type = "re"} uses the reference level in the random effects groups
  (except for \pkg{glmmTMB} models, see below), and prediction intervals
  also consider the uncertainty in the variance parameters. For models
  from \pkg{glmmTMB}, this type calls \code{predict(..., type = "link")}.
  \strong{Note:} For \pkg{glmmTMB} models, the random effect variances only
  affect the confidence intervals of predictions, not the predicted values
  themselves (because this is currently not implemented in \pkg{glmmTMB}),
  i.e. predicted values are on population-level. To get predicted values
  for each level of the random effects groups, add the name of the related
  random effect term to the \code{terms}-argument (for more details,
  see \href{../doc/effectsatvalues.html}{this vignette}).
  }
  \item{\code{"fe.zi"}}{
  Predicted values are conditioned on the fixed effects and the zero-inflation
  component. For instance, for models fitted with \code{zeroinfl}
  from \pkg{pscl}, this would return the predicted response and for \pkg{glmmTMB},
  this would return the expected value \code{mu*(1-p)} \emph{without}
  conditioning on random effects. For models of class \code{glmmTMB}, this type
  calls \code{predict(..., type = "response")}.
  }
  \item{\code{"re.zi"}}{
  Predicted values are conditioned on the random effects and the
  zero-inflation component. For models fitted with \pkg{glmmTMB}, this
  would return the expected value \code{mu*(1-p)}, conditioned on random
  effects. Prediction intervals also consider the uncertainty in the
  variance parameters. For models from \pkg{glmmTMB}, this type
  calls \code{simulate()}, because conditioning on random effects is
  not yet implemented in \code{predict.glmmTMB()}.
  }
  \item{\code{"surv"} and \code{"cumhaz"}}{
  Applies only to \code{coxph}-objects from the \pkg{survial}-package and
  calculates the survival probability or the cumulative hazard of an event.
  }
  \item{\code{"debug"}}{
  Only used internally.
  }
}}

\item{typical}{Character vector, naming the function to be applied to the
covariates over which the effect is "averaged". The default is "mean".
See \code{\link[sjstats]{typical_value}} for options.}

\item{ppd}{Logical, if \code{TRUE}, predictions for Stan-models are
based on the posterior predictive distribution
(\code{\link[rstantools]{posterior_predict}}). If \code{FALSE} (the
default), predictions are based on posterior draws of the linear
predictor (\code{\link[rstantools]{posterior_linpred}}).}

\item{x.as.factor}{Logical, if \code{TRUE}, preserves factor-class as
\code{x}-column in the returned data frame. By default, the \code{x}-column
is always numeric.}

\item{condition}{Named character vector, which indicates covariates that
should be held constant at specific values. Unlike \code{typical}, which
applies a function to the covariates to determine the value that is used
to hold these covariates constant, \code{condition} can be used to define
exact values, for instance \code{condition = c(covariate1 = 20, covariate2 = 5)}.
See 'Examples'.}

\item{...}{For \code{ggpredict()}, further arguments passed down to
\code{predict()}, and for \code{ggeffect()}, further arguments passed
down to \code{\link[effects]{Effect}}. If \code{model} is of class
\code{glmmTMB}, \code{...} may also be used to set the number of
simulation for bootstrapped confidence intervals, e.g. \code{nsim = 500}.}

\item{full.data}{Logical, if \code{TRUE}, the returned data frame contains
predictions for all observations. This data frame also has columns
for residuals and observed values, and can also be used to plot a
scatter plot of all data points or fitted values.
If \code{FALSE} (the default), the returned data frame only contains
predictions for all combinations of unique values of the model's
predictors. Residuals and observed values are set to \code{NA}.
Usually, this argument is only used internally by \code{ggaverage()}.}

\item{vcov.fun}{String, indicating the name of the \code{vcov*()}-function
from the \pkg{sandwich}-package, e.g. \code{vcov.fun = "vcovCL"},
which is used to compute robust standard errors for predictions.
If \code{NULL}, standard errors (and confidence intervals) for predictions
are based on the standard errors as returned by the \code{predict()}-function.
\strong{Note} that probably not all model objects that work with \code{ggpredict()}
are also supported by the \pkg{sandwich}-package.}

\item{vcov.type}{Character vector, specifying the estimation type for the
robust covariance matrix estimation (see \code{\link[sandwich]{vcovHC}}
for details).}

\item{vcov.args}{List of named vectors, used as additional arguments that
are passed down to \code{vcov.fun}.}
}

\description{
\code{ggpredict()} computes predicted (fitted) values for the

  predicted values. The result is returned as tidy data frame.

\details{
\strong{Supported Models}
  \cr \cr
  Currently supported model-objects are: \code{lm}, \code{glm}, \code{glm.nb},
  \code{lme}, \code{lmer}, \code{glmer}, \code{glmer.nb}, \code{nlmer},
  \code{glmmTMB}, \code{gam}, \code{vgam}, \code{gamm}, \code{gamm4},
  \code{multinom}, \code{betareg}, \code{gls}, \code{gee}, \code{plm},
  \code{lrm}, \code{polr}, \code{clm}, \code{clm2}, \code{hurdle}, \code{zeroinfl},
  \code{svyglm}, \code{svyglm.nb}, \code{truncreg}, \code{coxph},
  \code{stanreg}, \code{brmsfit}, \code{lmRob}, \code{glmRob}, \code{brglm}
  and \code{rlm}.
  Other models not listed here are passed to a generic predict-function
  and might work as well, or maybe with \code{ggeffect()}, which
  effectively does the same as \code{ggpredict()}. The main difference
  is that \code{ggpredict()} calls \code{predict()}, while \code{ggeffect()}
  calls \code{\link[effects]{Effect}} to compute marginal effects.
  \cr \cr
  \strong{Difference between \code{ggpredict()} and \code{ggeffect()}}
  \cr \cr
  \code{ggpredict()} and \code{ggeffect()} differ in how factors are
  held constant: \code{ggpredict()} uses the reference level, while
  \code{ggeffect()} computes a kind of "average" value, which represents
  the proportions of each factor's category.
  \cr \cr
  \strong{Marginal Effects at Specific Values}
  \cr \cr
  Specific values of model terms can be specified via the \code{terms}-argument.
  Indicating levels in square brackets allows for selecting only
  specific groups or values resp. value ranges. Term name and levels in
  brackets must be separated by a whitespace character, e.g.
  \code{terms = c("age", "education [1,3]")}. Numeric ranges, separated
  with colon, are also allowed: \code{terms = c("education", "age [30:60]")}.
  \cr \cr
  The \code{terms}-argument also supports the same shortcuts as the
  \code{values}-argument in \code{rprs_values()}. So
  \code{terms = "age [meansd]"} would return predictions for the values
  one standard deviation below the mean age, the mean age and
  one SD above the mean age. \code{terms = "age [quart2]"} would calculate
  predictions at the value of the lower, median and upper quartile of age.
  \cr \cr
  Furthermore, it is possible to specify a function name. Values for
  predictions will then be transformed, e.g. \code{terms = "income [exp]"}.
  This is useful when model predictors were transformed for fitting the
  model and should be back-transformed to the original scale for predictions.
  \cr \cr
  You can take a random sample of any size with \code{sample=n}, e.g
  \code{terms = "income [sample=8]"}, which will sample eight values from
  all possible values of the variable \code{income}. This option is especially
  useful for plotting marginal effects at certain levels of random effects
  group levels, where the group factor has many levels that can be completely
  plotted. For more details, see \href{../doc/effectsatvalues.html}{this vignette}.
  \cr \cr
  Finally, numeric vectors for which no specific values are given, a
  "pretty range" is calculated (see \code{\link{pretty_range}}), to avoid
  memory allocation problems for vectors with many unique values. If a numeric
  vector is specified as second or third term (i.e. if this vector represents
  a grouping structure), representative values (see \code{\link{rprs_values}})
  are chosen. If all values for a numeric vector should be used to compute
  predictions, you may use e.g. \code{terms = "age [all]"}. See also
  package vignettes.
  \cr \cr
  To create a pretty range that should be smaller or larger than the default
  range (i.e. if no specific values would be given), use the \code{n}-tag,
  e.g. \code{terms="age [n=5]"} or \code{terms="age [n=12]"}. Larger
  values for \code{n} return a larger range of predicted values.
  \cr \cr
  \strong{Holding covariates at constant values}
  \cr \cr
  For \code{ggpredict()}, if \code{full.data = FALSE}, \code{expand.grid()}
  is called on all unique combinations of \code{model.frame(model)[, terms]}
  and used as \code{newdata}-argument for \code{predict()}. In this case,
  all remaining covariates that are not specified in \code{terms} are
  held constant: Numeric values are set to the mean (unless changed with
  the \code{condition} or \code{typical}-argument), factors are set to their
  reference level (may also be changed with \code{condition}) and character
  vectors to their mode (most common element).
  \cr \cr
  \code{ggaverage()} computes the average predicted values, by calling
  \code{ggpredict()} with \code{full.data = TRUE}, where argument
  \code{newdata = model.frame(model)} is used in \code{predict()}.
  Hence, predictions are made on the model data. In this case, all
  remaining covariates that are not specified in \code{terms} are
  \emph{not} held constant, but vary between observations (and are
  kept as they happen to be). The predicted values are then averaged
  for each group (if any). Thus, \code{ggpredict()} can be considered
  as calculating marginal effects at the mean, while \code{ggaverage()}
  computes average marginal effects.
  \cr \cr
  \code{ggeffect()}, by default, sets remaining numeric covariates to
  their mean value, while for factors, a kind of "average" value, which
  represents the proportions of each factor's category, is used.
  \cr \cr
  \strong{Bayesian Regression Models}
  \cr \cr
  \code{ggpredict()} also works with \strong{Stan}-models from
  the \CRANpkg{rstanarm} or \CRANpkg{brms}-package. The predicted
  values are the median value of all drawn posterior samples. The
  confidence intervals for Stan-models are actually high density
  intervals, computed by \code{\link[sjstats]{hdi}}, unless \code{ppd = TRUE}.
  If \code{ppd = TRUE}, predictions are based on draws of the posterior
  predictive  distribution and the uncertainty interval is computed
  using  \code{\link[rstantools]{predictive_interval}}. By default (i.e.
  \code{ppd = FALSE}), the predictions are based on
  \code{\link[rstantools]{posterior_linpred}} and hence have some
  limitations: the uncertainty of the error term is not taken into
  account. The recommendation is to use the posterior predictive
  distribution (\code{\link[rstantools]{posterior_predict}}).
  Note that for binomial models, the \code{newdata}-argument
  used in \code{posterior_predict()} must also contain the vector
  with the number of trials. In this case, a dummy-vector is used,
  where all values for the response are set to 1.
  \cr \cr
  \strong{Zero-Inflated Mixed Models with glmmTMB}
  \cr \cr
  If \code{model} is of class \code{glmmTMB}, bootstrapped confidence
  intervals are calculated for predictions conditioned on the zero-inflated
  part of the model, when the uncertainty in the random-effect paramters
  is ignored (i.e. when \code{type = "fe.zi"}, see Brooks et al. 2017, pp.391-392
  for details). \code{type = "fe.zi"} returns predicted values at population
  \emph{mode}, not mean. If predictions are also conditioned on random
  effects (i.e. \code{type = "re.zi"}), predicted values are based on
  simulations (see Brooks et al. 2017, pp.392-393 for details).
}
\note{
Since data for \code{ggaverage()} comes from the model frame, not all
  possible combinations of values in \code{terms} might be present in the data,
  thus lines or confidence bands from \code{plot()} might not span over
  the complete x-axis-range.
  \cr \cr
  \code{polr}-, \code{clm}-models, or more generally speaking, models with
  ordinal or multinominal outcomes, have an additional column
  \code{response.level}, which indicates with which level of the response
  variable the predicted values are associated.
  \cr \cr
  The \code{print()}-method gives a clean output (especially for predictions
  by groups), and indicates at which values covariates were held constant.
  Furthermore, the \code{print()}-method has the arguments \code{digits} and
  \code{n} to control number of decimals and lines to be printed.
